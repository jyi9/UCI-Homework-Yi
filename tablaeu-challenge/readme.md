The initial bar graph created displays the average trip duration by gender. Upon analysis of the gender and trip duration data, we can conclude that females tend to have longer trip durations than males. Similarly, the map on the second sheet displays the average trip duration in each area based on birth year and gender. It is clear that on average, older individuals average longer trip durations. This is understanable as older individuals might ride bikes as a means of transportation for work. Additionally, the data is clustered in central New Jersey, indicating that most individuals utilize the stations there. The final map categorizes the most popular start stations based on the number of stations in each area. This can be useful to see which stations are most used, and which stations might need to be closed down.
